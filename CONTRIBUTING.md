New Problem And Solution

I have seen it in a Coursera specialization on Datastructure and Algorithm assignment.
I found the problem interesting and it increased my intuition of dynamic programming.

I believe the question difficulty fits in easy or medium category.

I feel the question would help people who are trying to master Dynamic programming technique. People often
start with classical problem to master dynamic programming. It's a nice variation of classical LCS problem.
The problem is easy enough for beginner to start thinking about it and it would consolidate the understanding 
of idea behind LCS and overall dynamic programming.

Longest Common Subsequence of Three Sequences
Task. Given three sequences 𝐴 = (𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛), 𝐵 = (𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚), and 𝐶 = (𝑐1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑙), find the
length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer 𝑝 such that there
exist indices 1 ≤ 𝑖1 < 𝑖2 < · · · < 𝑖𝑝 ≤ 𝑛, 1 ≤ 𝑗1 < 𝑗2 < · · · < 𝑗𝑝 ≤ 𝑚, 1 ≤ 𝑘1 < 𝑘2 < · · · < 𝑘𝑝 ≤ 𝑙 such
that 𝑎𝑖1 = 𝑏𝑗1 = 𝑐𝑘1
